            - its referent
                - a (§) subjoining waybit
        - the mapping between jointers and joints entire is 1:1
            - each jointer effectively declares a separate joint
            ( the same is not true of subjoining waybits, which map to joints 1:N
        - the joint is declared unidirectionally
            - from jointer to subjoining waybit
            - for sake of general simplicity and robustness
                - subordinate building blocks (e.g. underbits) can be implemented
                  blind to the uses (overbits) they will be put in future
                    - discourages unecessary overbit attachements/assumptions
                      that would tend to increase complexity
                      and decrease robustness of the overall structure
                - a node (e.g. overbit) can fully define its own edges
                    - no underbit being able to contradict the definition
                    - which simplifies machine (and human) processing of the structure
    [ effect
        - the effect of a referential joint is determined
          by definite, but hypothetical wayscript changes (effective changes)
        - its effect is what the effective changes would introduce
        - effective changes of a referential joint:
            * any referential joint
                - the subjoining waybit gains a parent (effective parent)
                  which is the parent of the jointer
                    - in addition to its declared parent
            * bitform referential joint
                ( additional to the above
                - where it infrabuts the effective parent, the subjoining waybit:
                    - takes the local name of the bitform jointer
                        - which thereby masks (at this location) its declared local name
                    - takes all attributes of the bitform jointer
                        - which thereby extend and/or mask (at this location) its declared attributes
                - the bitform jointer is removed
                - in other words, the subjoining waybit (at this location)
                  pretty much merges with the jointer
    [ causality and dependence relations
        - owing to how the effect of a referential joint is determined
            ( § Referential joint § effect
            - no referential joint can bring its subjoining waybit into a relation of causality
              in the role of effect
            - nor of dependence in the role of dependant
        - adding a nested waybit to a hyperform jointer (the only form that allows such addition)
            - thus bringing it into a relation of causality or dependence
            - would not bring the subjoining waybit into the same relation
        - the subjoining waybit (in gaining the same parent) becomes a *sibling* to the jointer
