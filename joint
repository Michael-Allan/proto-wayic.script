            (noun) an effective junction

            <!-- Elements that adjoin do not thereby form a joint.  The elaborate terminology
              of referential jointing rests on this distinction, which itself rests on 'joint'
              in English connoting artifice: the joint is an artificial means of junction
              as opposed to the natural means of writing in place. -->
